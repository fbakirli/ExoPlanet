# ExoLearn
ExoLearn is an innovative educational platform designed to engage elementary school children in learning exoplanets through interactive learning materials. We are developing a user-friendly website which will capture the students' interest with visual storytelling, games and even quizzes to educate them about the discovered exoplanets, which will then be linked to NASAâ€™s Exoplanet Exploration Program for credible scientific insights. Our platform tackles the challenging aspects of teaching elementary students astronomical concepts by making them accessible, understandable and exciting for the students. We achieve this goal by gamification, interactive visuals, and quizzes, and with a main character of an alien who has an interesting backstory to grab students' attention. ExoLearn will be breaking down the scientific barriers of learning science, while making the learning process engaging and enjoyable. We believe ExoLearn will spark curiosity in young minds and inspire future scientists by combining science, creativity and technology, thus making it an essential platform for teaching process. Our team is confident this project will succeed, due to the rising interest in space exploration and the search for habitable exoplanets. This growing interest fuels curiosity, making our platform even more relevant and engaging for learners.
